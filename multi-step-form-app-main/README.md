## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- Jest
- MVC Architectural pattern

### What I learned

This is the first time I've applied some structure regarding SCSS files and I also learned about the MVC archetictural pattern with regards to JS code. I learned about some accessibility attributes such as role='listbox' which makes it so it lets user know that there is a list of items to select that are not <select> elements that contain images. In conjuction with the role ='option' attribute which tells users which elements are options. I also learned about some aria attributes like aria-label, aria-selected, etc. These help visually impaired users understand what is happening via screenreaders informing them. 

### Useful resources

- [webdesignerdepot.com](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2020/12/2-smartest-ways-to-structure-sass/) - This helped me learn how to better structure my SCSS files/folders.
- [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes) - This helped me learn more specific accessibility attributes to make non-semantic elements more accessible for screenreaders/visually impaired users.
